# Draw SVG-Fonts with paper.js and two.js

I wired up some existing examples of paper.js and two.js to display self-drawn custom svg-fonts. A demo of this repo can be found [here](http://tmerse.github.io/SVG_FONT/). There also is a [blog-post](http://www.tmerse.com/2013-06-17-Draw-your-own-SVG-Font.html).

## Usage

- Draw inside the svg area, the font will be updated accordingly.
- Change the text inside the textbox.
- Hit render/stop to display result.
